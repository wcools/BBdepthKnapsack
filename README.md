Depth First Branch and Bound algorithm to deal with the Knapsack problem (toy example)

Following a Coursera course on optimisation I set up this branch and bound in R. The code specifically addresses the knapsack problem and should be adapted if other problems are of interest. The basic structure in R should nevertheless remain the same.
